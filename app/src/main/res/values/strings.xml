    <string name="whatsNewDesc0">The new Read Aloud feature lets you listen to sets of questions and answers. The words played are displayed on the screen. You can change the speed of reading words.\n\nThe function works in the background, so when listening to the set, you can use other applications or listen to the set on the go without having to constantly use the phone. You can go back to the previous word, go to the next one, or stop playback at any time.
\n\nReading aloud can be found on the main page in the set menu (3 dots next to the set name).</string>
    <string name="whatsNewDesc1">In update 2.5, the appearance of the main page was slightly rebuilt.\n\nThe Test button has been replaced by a drop-down menu with links to the Fast Learning and Read Aloud functions as well as a link to the Set Settings.
\n\nIn addition, with version 2.5 sets on the main page are sorted from newest to oldest (not as before from oldest to newest).\n\nThe display of the set name has also been changed. If the name is long, it will be scaled to a smaller size.</string>
    <string name="whatsNewDesc2">The new Set Settings page allows you to edit the configuration of the set, i.e. enable/disable ignoring special characters and change the set languages (used in the Read aloud function).
\n\nIn the future, more options and settings will appear there.</string>
    <string name="whatsNewDesc3">- The application settings code has been rewritten, so the settings should load faster   - If the user answers the question correctly when more than one answer is correct, the remaining correct answers will be displayed   - Prevented sharing of unnamed sets   - A message has been added on the home page that shows when the application is updated to the latest feature update   - Added What\'s New page with a list of changes in the latest feature update</string>
