    <string name="fastLearningDescription">In the Fast Learning module, the user chooses from which sets he wants to learn and selects the number of questions, and the application, based on his previous answers, intelligently selects the questions.\n\nThe Quick Learn session continues until the user has answered all the questions correctly. At the same time, the duration of the session and the number of correct, incorrect and all answers are counted during the Fast Learning.</string>
    <string name="readAloudDescription">Reading aloud allows you to read the set chosen by the user. \n\nThe function works in the background, so you can listen to the sets, e.g. on the way to school.
