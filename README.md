# RepeatsJava
Repeats is a free (and now open source!) app to learning  for Android (this project) and Windows 10 (coming soon on GitHub).
### How it works?
App will send a notification to you with question with specific frequency and will check if your answer is correct and if it's not, app will show the correct answer.
In addition to this, Repeats has built-in Test feature which help you check your knowledge quickly.

In Repeats, you must create your own database with questions & answers to use the app.
### It's my first time on GitHub...
...and in open source community. And also, Repeats is my first big project (I've been programming for 3 years as a hobby). I will be grateful for any comments to my code.
