# RepeatsJava
Repeats is a free (and now open source!) app to learning  for Android (this project) and Windows 10 (coming soon on GitHub).
### How it works?
App will send a notification to you with question with specific frequency and will check if your answer is correct and if it's not, app will show the correct answer.

### It's my first time on GitHub...
...and in open source community. Also, Repeats is my first big project (I've been programming for 3 years as a hobby). I will be grateful for any comments to my code.
